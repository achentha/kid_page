## Kid Page

Sometimes my son forgets things he has to do, place where he is supposed to be at, etc. And google calendar seems to be a bit too boring for him to use. I decided to create this App for him and added some minecraft image/gif to make it a bit more fun for him to use.

Now he can:
* create his own user account
* modify his profile
* delete his account(hopefully he will not do this)
* add todo items into his Todo List
* edit the todo items
* mark an item as completed
* delete an item from the Todo List

## Technologies Used
* Ruby on Rails
* ActiveRecords/Postgresql for backend DB
* bcrypt for password authentication
* Materize for Responsiveness

## Deployment on Heroku
* Here is the link to heroku: https://kid-page.herokuapp.com/

## Acknowledgement/Credit
* This will not be created if not for Zachary. Thanks son.
